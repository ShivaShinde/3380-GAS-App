The Gas App project is to design a software that not only gives local gas prices and nearest locations but also calculates from that location information and the average gas mileage for a given vehicle what the actual cost of driving to a given gas station in order to buy gas; essentially giving the "actual cost" of using a given gas station. Another addition to this app would be traffic data that also goes into the calculations, but that could be for a future release. 

The app will need to have selectable and savable car data for the user, and access to a database of car information to retrieve actual mileage information. It would also need access to a database that contains pricing and location information for stations. For the future traffic data addition of course traffic data would be mandatory.
