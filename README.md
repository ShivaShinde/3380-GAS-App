3380-GAS-App
============
Update: The application's name has officially been changed to "SmartPump." Edits will be made to code and materials when it is modified.

The SmartPump project's goal is to rethink the formulaic approach to fuel resource pricing. Standard fuel applications simply compare cost when helping a customer determine which fueling station is best. SmartPump is different. 

SmartPump is a software that not only gives local gas prices and nearest locations but also calculates from that location information and the average gas mileage for a given vehicle what the actual cost of driving to a given gas station in order to buy gas; essentially giving the "actual cost" of using a given gas station. Another addition to this app would is traffic data that also goes into the calculations. 

The application will have saveable car data and favorite stations listings one the user has decided what their "goto" locations are. The added functionality of a trip mode will allow the user to let the application know what route they are already taking so it can consider stations cost and distance from the given path. Development is still underway. Please feel free to find bugs and suggest updates.
